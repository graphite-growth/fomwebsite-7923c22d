    fullDescription: `Most marketers aren't being replaced by AI — they're being replaced by marketers who actually know how to use it.

In this launch episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Camille Ricketts (Operating Partner, XYZ), Ethan Smith (CEO, Graphite Growth), and Mada Seghete (CEO & Co-Founder, Upside) cut through the AI hype and talk about what they believe is changing inside marketing teams.

They discuss real use cases for AI (both personal and professional) and outline the best ways to tackle early adoption in times riddled with apprehension and uncertainty. Drilling down on why most teams are stuck using AI to make "bad" work faster, they discuss the possibility of using AI as a potential source for unconventional ideas that complement human storytelling.

From the LinkedIn AI content trap to why Reddit might be the most underrated channel for market intelligence, the hosts explore the uncomfortable tradeoffs marketers are already facing: how to (and should you) stay authentic in a landscape that's becoming overpersonalized? Along the way, you'll hear why one of our hosts refuses to let AI write their LinkedIn posts (while another has successfully used it and hit 500K views), how Ethan is using AI to find SEO patterns humans can't see, and why Camille is betting on storytelling talent as the most valuable skill of the next decade.`,

    fullDescription: `Most marketing teams are "using AI." Very few are actually operationalizing it.

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Mada Seghete and Ethan Smith are joined by Meagen Eisenberg, CMO of Samsara, to break down how she rebuilt her marketing org around AI agents and what changed as a result.

Meagen shares exactly how her team deployed 13 live AI marketing agents (with 26 more on the way) to replace expensive SaaS tools, automate 50% of marketing ops tickets, and enable a flat team to drive significant growth in pipeline. The real story isn't the agents themselves - it's the operating model behind them. AI adoption didn't happen organically; it was enforced through training, internal hackathons, performance reviews, and a culture that made daily AI usage non-negotiable.

The conversation tackles the uncomfortable tradeoffs leaders now face: when to build vs. buy, how much technical skill marketers really need, and why AI doesn't eliminate creativity - it removes the production work that held it back. Meagen also explains why she still believes intimate in-person dinners outperform webinars, how Samsara tracks LLM visibility using Lighthouse, an internally built AI tool, and why pipeline per marketer is a key productivity metric.

This episode is a practical blueprint for CMOs and marketing leaders who want AI to move the business, not just the slide deck.`,

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Camille Ricketts and Mada Seghete talk with Lena Waters, CMO of Notion, about how one of the world's most beloved productivity tools is evolving into an AI-connected workspace and how that shift shows up not just in the product, but across the entire organization.

Lena shares how Notion avoids the common trap of treating AI like a feature add-on. Instead, her team challenges customers to rethink whether existing workflows should exist at all. The conversation explores how Notion collapses discovery time in enterprise deals by bringing prospects directly into the product, why PLG and enterprise are part of the same continuous loop, and how internal teams move from idea to market in hours, not weeks.

They also tackle bigger questions most marketers aren't ready for yet: whether traditional websites and landing pages are becoming legacy artifacts, why storytelling still matters as much as attribution, and how empowering customers and employees to tell your brand story creates more consistency than strict brand governance ever could.

This episode is a blueprint for marketing leaders navigating the shift from AI as automation to AI as transformation.`,

In a world where AI can generate anything, trust determines what customers actually believe.\n\nThe conversation digs into why the average CMO tenure is just 18 months, and how attribution theater, not incremental ROI, is quietly eroding marketing's credibility inside companies. Dave argues that marketing teams must tie their work to real, dollar-based impact measured against a single north star metric, or risk being seen as cost centers rather than growth drivers.\n\nThis episode is a candid blueprint for marketing leaders who want to prove value to the CFO, build durable trust with customers, and evolve their teams before the market forces them to.",

    fullDescription: `What happens when cutting-edge marketing meets the everyday realities of small business owners?

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Mada Seghete and Camille Ricketts talk with Lindsey Irvine, Chief Marketing Officer at Square, about how marketing is fundamentally shifting in an AI-driven world, especially when your audience isn't made up of tech insiders, but real-world business operators.

Lindsey brings a unique perspective shaped by her experience across Salesforce, MuleSoft, Benchling, and now Square. At the core of her approach is a relentless focus on customer obsession—meeting business owners where they are, understanding their real-world challenges, and building marketing strategies that prioritize simplicity, trust, and time savings over technical complexity.

A central theme throughout the conversation is the emergence of marketing's new "dual mandate." It's no longer enough to create content that resonates with human buyers—you also need to create content that AI agents can discover, interpret, and recommend. As search behavior shifts toward LLMs and AI-powered overviews, traditional SEO strategies are breaking down. Lindsey shares how her team is adapting by prioritizing earned media, community-driven platforms like Reddit and YouTube, and structured, data-backed content that signals credibility to both humans and machines.

The episode also dives into the operational side of AI in marketing. Lindsey emphasizes that AI is not a shortcut for strategy—it's a multiplier. The real opportunity lies in identifying high-impact workflows that can be automated end-to-end, such as ad bidding, lead scoring, and campaign optimization, rather than simply layering AI on top of existing processes. At the same time, she highlights the importance of maintaining a strong core message that anchors the entire organization, preventing fragmentation across channels, segments, and geographies.

Looking ahead, Lindsey believes the future marketing organization will be defined by AI-first thinking, fewer but more empowered teams, and leaders who act as cross-functional "quarterbacks," orchestrating both human and AI resources to scale impact. The mindset is shifting from hiring more people to building systems and even AI agents that can 10x output without increasing headcount.`,

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Ethan Smith and Camille Ricketts talk with Idan Koren, Chief Marketing Officer at Verkada, about how he's built marketing from the ground up into a highly technical organization as the company scaled from startup to Series F.

Idan approaches marketing with the mindset of a scientist - treating data as the foundation for experimentation and AI as a tool to stress-test decisions. Instead of focusing on flashy automation, his team invests in the operational systems that quietly drive performance: attribution frameworks, lead routing infrastructure, deliverability management, and databases of first-party interaction data.

One key theme throughout the conversation is that the most powerful AI applications rely on proprietary signals. Verkada's team captures every interaction with prospects, from emails and call recordings to CRM notes and uses that data to power highly contextual outreach that references real past conversations. The result is personalization that actually works at scale.

Idan also challenges several common assumptions about AI in marketing. For example, he argues that the biggest barrier to scaling outbound email isn't copy quality, it's deliverability and inbox reputation. And while many companies are focused on AI-driven "next best action" systems, he believes the underlying infrastructure needed to support those systems is still largely unsolved.

Ultimately, Idan's perspective is pragmatic: AI can accelerate execution and analysis, but marketing still requires human judgment, creative thinking, and disciplined operational systems to drive real growth.`,

    fullDescription: `What if the marketing funnel isn't just outdated but actively holding you back?

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Camille Ricketts and Mada Seghete sit down with Wendy Werve, Chief Market Officer at Comply, to unpack a fundamentally different way to think about go-to-market in an AI-driven world.

Wendy challenges the traditional funnel model, arguing that buyer journeys are no longer linear or predictable. Instead, she introduces the concept of "pinball marketing" — a dynamic, signal-driven approach where teams respond to real-time buyer intent rather than forcing prospects through predefined stages. In this world, success depends less on controlling the journey and more on recognizing and reacting to high-intent moments as they happen.

A central theme in the conversation is the shift from volume-based marketing to precision and speed. Wendy explains how AI enables teams to detect signals, personalize outreach, and respond faster than ever before, making speed-to-lead and relevance far more important than sheer output. This shift also requires rethinking measurement: moving away from MQLs and vanity metrics toward pipeline, conversion rates, and true revenue impact.

The discussion also dives into the importance of defining the right ICP. Wendy emphasizes that ICP and persona are often confused, and that the most effective teams use data, not intuition, to identify which customers actually drive long-term value. By aligning marketing, sales, and product around these insights, companies can dramatically improve efficiency and outcomes.

Finally, the episode explores what it takes to build and sustain high-performing teams. From breaking down silos across go-to-market functions to modeling personal sustainability as a leader, Wendy underscores that long-term success comes from both operational excellence and a culture that prioritizes endurance over burnout.`,

    fullDescription: `What does it take to market a product when the category itself doesn't fully exist yet?

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Ethan Smith and Camille Ricketts sit down with Cecilia Stallsmith, CMO at Lovable, to unpack the realities of building and scaling marketing in one of the fastest-moving spaces in tech.

Ceci brings a rare perspective shaped by her experience scaling developer ecosystems, advising founders, and now leading marketing at a company redefining how software gets built. At Lovable, the challenge isn't just go-to-market execution, it's defining the narrative for a product that serves multiple audiences at once: developers, non-technical founders, and enterprise buyers.

A central theme in the conversation is the misconception that developers are "immune" to marketing. In reality, Ceci argues they are deeply influenced by brand, identity, and culture—just in less obvious ways. Choosing a tool isn't just a functional decision; it's a signal of taste and belonging. That insight fundamentally changes how teams should approach messaging, design, and community-building.

The episode also explores the complexity of category creation in the age of AI. With terms like "vibe coding" and "agentic software" emerging rapidly, Ceci explains why locking into buzzwords too early can backfire. Instead, her approach is to run multiple messaging experiments simultaneously and let the market determine what sticks, rather than forcing a single narrative prematurely.

AI's role in marketing is another major focus—but not in the way most teams think. Ceci emphasizes that the real advantage isn't AI-generated content, but the ability to dramatically compress feedback loops. Faster testing, quicker iteration, and real-time insights allow smaller teams to run more campaigns, take more risks, and learn faster than ever before.

Finally, Ceci addresses the rise of AI-driven "consensus" and how it impacts brand perception. As AI systems synthesize years of content from across the internet, companies must actively shape their narrative by flooding the ecosystem with fresh, credible signals, rather than trying to erase outdated positioning.

The takeaway is clear: in a market defined by rapid change, the winners will be the ones willing to experiment faster, adapt constantly, and build brands people want to belong to.`,

In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Ethan Smith and Mada Seghete sit down with Alina Vandenberghe, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Chili Piper, to unpack her unconventional approach to marketing: reducing her team from 22 marketers to just 2, while increasing performance and driving over 1,400 qualified booked meetings annually.

Alina brings a deeply technical and entrepreneurial perspective to marketing. With a background in computer science and experience building products used by millions, she approached marketing like an engineering problem, auditing every task, measuring impact versus effort, and systematically automating what didn't require human creativity.

A core theme throughout the conversation is that most marketing teams are overloaded with low-impact, repetitive work. By identifying and automating up to 80% of these tasks, Alina was able to free up time and resources to focus on what actually drives growth: strategy, creativity, and bold thinking.

The discussion also challenges traditional metrics. Alina explains why booked meetings alone can be misleading and emphasizes the importance of tracking the full customer journey, from pipeline to retention, to understand true business impact. She also highlights how small, often invisible improvements, like filtering out fake leads, can have outsized effects on team productivity and morale.

Another key focus is the evolving role of AI. While AI excels at handling repetitive and data-heavy tasks, Alina argues that it naturally trends toward average outcomes. The real competitive advantage comes from human marketers who can take contrarian positions, demonstrate taste, and create emotionally resonant work that stands out.

Ultimately, this conversation reframes the role of marketing teams: not as executors of campaigns, but as strategic operators who leverage AI to move faster, think bigger, and focus on the work that truly differentiates.`,

He also explains why brand can act like performance spend, how AEO requires repeated message consensus across trusted sources, and why the modern marketing team needs product marketers, systems architects, and creator-style operators.",

      "In this episode of Future of Marketing, hosts Mada Seghete and Ethan Smith sit down with Jonathan Kvarfordt, VP of Marketing at 1mind, to unpack how AI is changing pipeline generation, buyer coverage, and the structure of GTM teams. Jonathan argues that most teams are using AI too narrowly by trying to make old workflows faster, cheaper, and easier, especially around meeting booking. Instead, he makes the case for using AI to create better buyer experiences, answer deeper product questions, support solutioning, and move buyers further through the decision process before a human gets involved. He also shares how human effort, customer amplification, trusted communities, valuable content, AEO, and AI-powered analysis shaped his GTM approach at Momentum and now at 1mind.",
